### CODING CHALLENGE #2: REPORT

I used 6 else-if statements, because I see this as an effective way to look at the comparison of systolic pressure and Dialostic pressure. The last else statement shows that the Dialostic is greater than the sistolic pressure. This leaves it easy to read, and go through if there are any errors. 
I could have use conditional statements instead of using else-if which is similar but would have been shorter. I could have also reduced the number of conditions and expressions. I am not sure how else to approach it in a way where we have not learned, but I know that conditional statements are nice and sweet.
